## 🚀 Overview

**Flux2Max** is a lightweight, professional-grade playground designed to unleash the full potential of **FLUX.2 [max]** by Black Forest Labs. 

While most interfaces focus solely on generation, Flux2Max provides a complete creative workflow. From initial idea to refined asset, we enable creators to experience the "state-of-the-art" capabilities of FLUX.2: top-tier image quality, precise prompt following, and unprecedented editing consistency.

> **Note**: This is an independent project by [Orvyno](https://github.com/orvyno) and is not affiliated with Black Forest Labs.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 High-Fidelity Generation
Generate stunning images with the **FLUX.2 [max]** model. Experience text rendering, complex composition handling, and photorealistic details that set a new industry standard.

### 🛠️ Iterative Editing
Don't settle for "almost right." Use our **Instruction-Based Editing** to tweak details, adjust lighting, or modify subjects without losing the essence of your original image.

### 🎭 Surface Retexturing
A specialized mode for designers. Keep the geometry and structure of your object but completely swap its material or surface style. Perfect for product visualization and logo design.

### 🆚 Smart Comparison
Stop guessing. Our built-in **Comparison Slider** and **Version History** let you compare your edits side-by-side with the original, ensuring every change improves your work.

### 🌍 Share Your Process
Create beautiful, shareable **Work Pages** that showcase your entire creative journey—from the first prompt to the final polished result.
